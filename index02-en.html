    <h3 class="h3-title left">Introduction.</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">In my last post, I summarized the angel taxation program, known as the special tax exception for entrepreneur.</p>
    <span class="prev-text">If you haven't read the 1st article yet, click here.</span>

      READ 1st ARTICLE
    </a>
    <p class="p-text left">The key point of this program is that the business must be innovative. According to my research conducted with METI, there is no strict requirement that the business should be something completely unique and one-of-a-kind, if the newly established company is simply imitating a business that has been certified as an qualified company for angel taxation in the past, or a so-called conventional business that is already widely known in the world, however, the company may not be able to get an approval from the prefectural government so that the company cannot make use of the special tax exemption program. On the basic premise that we can fulfill these conditions, you may be wondering what kind of investors (entrepreneurs) this special tax exception for entrepreneur is suitable for?<br>
      In this article, I, a certified tax accountant, would like to introduce several cases in which the special tax exemption for entrepreneur may be effective from the viewpoint of tax-saving.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">(1)Take advantage of the very gentle requirements regarding promoters</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">As explained in my 1st article, the special tax exemption for entrepreneur is only granted to the "promoter" himself/herself. However, the system basically requires a minimum of two full-time researchers or persons engaged in new business activities, although there are some exceptions. In many cases, therefore, a company may be started by co-financing with a few partners. In such a case, if he and his co-investor both become promoters of the joint stock company and make a cash payment, both of them will be eligible for the special tax exemption for entrepreneur.<br>
      In addition, there may be cases where the promoter has other work and cannot devote himself/herself to the business as a full-time researcher or as a person engaged in new business activities. In such cases, the promoter does not necessarily need to be a full-time researcher or a person engaged in new business activities, and at least two other researchers or persons engaged in new business activities are eligible for the special tax exemption for entrepreneur. Furthermore, the promoter is not necessarily required to be director for the new established company.<br>
      Therefore, even businessperson who is currently having a primary job as a salaried worker or manager of another company, and who find it difficult to run a side business, may be able to apply for the special tax exemption for entrepreneur if the business person would be a founder and then can find a partner who can devote himself/herself to the businesses on a full-time basis, which means that more investors than expected are being given the chance to take advantage of this program.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">(2)Combination with Special measures under “business succession taxation program for a company”</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">I feel that this special tax exemption for entrepreneur is effective for those who have a large amount of financial assets such as stocks and are elderly. For example, it is well known that when a person who owns high-value financial assets would die and inheritance procedures would occur, inheritance tax is imposed on the heirs at the time of inheritance, and then personal income is imposed on the sale of the inherited shares if they are sold by the heirs.<br>
      Therefore, by utilizing the special tax exemption for entrepreneur, if you can establish a Kabushiki Kaisha with yourself as the promoter and representative, and receive a letter of confirmation from the prefectural government, you can first avoid capital gain taxation on your own financial assets. （FYI: Although the special tax exemption for entrepreneur does not necessarily require the promoter to be the representative, we shall establish a company with the promoter as the representative and his/her children as directors in preparation for future schemes in our case study. I would like you to look at the following diagram with the image of establishing a company based on this premise.）.</p>
    <div class="top-image">
      <img src="./images/top/article-en-2-01.png" alt="Corporate Exception Structure">
    </div>
    <p class="p-text left">Many readers may have noticed that this scheme gives rise to a new problem that the financial assets sold shall be converted into stocks acquired at the time of the company's establishment and then this stock must be subject to inheritance tax if the promotor would die in the future. However, I analyze that the tax deferment system for gift and inheritance taxes, which is based on the business succession taxation program(事業承継税制), can be used effectively to address this issue.<br>
      I would like to omit a detailed explanation of the business succession taxation program in this article. For example, however, if a father who started a business as a promotor as well as representative director manages the business together with his son (who is a director) for more than three years, and if the father transfers the representative position to his son before making a gift of stock, and then donates his own stock to his son (who is at least 18 years old), the son may not be subject to gift tax under tax regulation so called “deferral of gift tax payment(贈与税の納税の猶予). （Please be noted that there are some other requirements to get an approval of the “deferral of gift tax payment” under Japanese tax law.）<br>
      Even if the father passes away before executing the gift, if the son meets certain requirements, such as being an director immediately before the start of inheritance and being a representative within 5 months of the start of inheritance, the deferment of inheritance tax payment (相続税の納税の猶予)can be applied.<br>
      In addition, the amount of tax payment that has been postponed can be exempted by submitting a notification to the tax office if certain conditions are met, such as the death of the successor （i.e. death of son in my example）and the succession of the business to the next successor.<br><br>
      Of course, there are a wide variety of requirements for the application of the business succession taxation program (法人版事業承継税制), and we should carefully check in advance before implementing this scheme. Furthermore, it should be noted that the said program is divided into special measures(特例措置) and general measures（一般措置）, and that the deadline for submitting a special approval plan for special measures is March 31, 2024.<br>
      Nevertheless, it is worth noting that investors who expect to pay high taxes on both personal income tax and inheritance tax will be able to realize significant tax savings by combining the tax exemption system under “the special tax exemption for entrepreneur” and “the tax deferment program under the business succession tax program for a company”.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">(3)Tax advantages under the EXIT phase of your business</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">The treatment of a venture company established under this program may be of concern if the business fails and the company is forced to close down. Fortunately, the special tax exemption for entrepreneur is based on the requirements of the company as of December 31 of the year of incorporation (and the requirements of the individuals who established the company), and does not require the new established company to continue its business for a long time. Therefore, even if a company established under the special tax exemption for entrepreneur is forced to close its business in the following year, there is no concern that the tax treatment in the year of establishment will be retroactively revoked.<br>
      Furthermore, even if a venture company is forced to transfer its shares to another company at a lower price due to difficulties in maintaining its business, the loss on the sales of stocks can be offset with income from the transfer of listed shares as well as non-listed shares<br>
      In general, loses that could not be offset with another capital gain in the year of stock sales cannot be carried forward to the next year if the loss is caused by the transfer of unlisted shares, However, under this special tax exemption for entrepreneur, the loss can be carried forward for three years regardless of general treatment of losses caused by the sales of unlisted shares. In other words, it is reassuring to know that the program permits "profit/loss aggregation" and "carryover loss for 3 years, which are not normally permitted for the transfer of unlisted shares, as in the conventional angel taxation system.<br>
      On the other hand, if a venture company becomes successful and the founder sells the company for a large sum of money, resulting in a huge amount of capital gain, how is the gain taxed? Regarding this the amount equivalent to the capital paid in at the time of application of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur can be included in the acquisition cost in the calculation of capital gain on the sales.<br>
      In other words, the amount of money paid at the time of company establishment is not only treated as tax-free in the calculation of capital gain in the year of company establishment, but can also be included as an acquisition cost when the company is sold in the future (EXIT phase). This is a revolutionary tax-saving measure not found in the conventional angel taxation system (Preferential Treatment A and B). </p>
      <div class="top-image">
        <img src="./images/top/article-en-2-02.png" alt="Corporate Exception Structure">
      </div>
      <p class="p-text02 left">Furthermore, this special tax exemption for entrepreneur is also applicable to cases of successive startups. See the chart above.<br>
        For example, let us consider the case where a venture company (Company A) established under the special tax exemption for entrepreneur is sold to a third-party investor and the promotor realizes a large capital gain. Normally, the gain on the sale of shares in Company A is subject to personal income tax, but if a new venture company (Company B) is established in the same year as the founder and Company B again applies for and is approved for the special tax exemption for entrepreneur, the amount of the investment in Company B can be deductible in calculating the capital gain of Company A, which means the promotor can be exempt from personal income tax caused by the sales of Company A (for the portion of investment in Company B). Of course, if there are similarities between the businesses of Company A and Company B, it should be interpreted that the application for the special tax exemption for Company B is not approved. However, it is worthwhile to keep in mind this tax saving scheme by using this “successive startups scheme”.</p>
      <h3 class="h3-title left">(4)The special tax exemption for entrepreneur is not irrelevant for investors living abroad.</h3>
      <div class="top-image">
        <img src="./images/top/article-en-2-03.png" alt="個人要件">
      </div>
      <p class="p-text02 left">This special tax exemption for entrepreneur should also be of interest to entrepreneurs who are non-residents currently residing abroad but who intend to set up a venture company in Japan in the future. The principle source rule is that capital gains on stocks and other securities by individuals are subject to tax in their country of residence.<br>
        Namely, according to general principles of international tax law. if a non-resident who resides abroad sells financial assets locally overseas (unless there are special circumstances such as living in a country that has not adopted capital gains taxation under the local tax law), he/she will be subject to personal income tax in the country where he/she lives.<br>
        However, even if a foreign investor moves to Japan, sells his/her shares, and establishes a Kabushiki Kaisha as a promoter to start a venture business, the capital gain equivalent to the amount paid in is exempt from personal income tax if the special tax exemption for entrepreneur can be used here in Japan. As a supplementary note, the scope of securities that are exempt from capital gains taxation under this program includes not only overseas-listed shares acquired overseas, but also shares in unlisted companies established outside Japan.<br>
        In addition, as mentioned above, promotor of a company established under the special tax exemption for entrepreneur can enjoy tax benefits during the EXIT phase, not to mention the opportunity for tax deferment under business succession taxation program for the company in the future.<br>
        There is a caveat to tax-saving schemes by non-residents of Japan aimed at avoiding capital gains taxation in the local country. For example, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the U.S. have taxation systems known as Exis Tax, which allow the taxing authority in the country of residence where the individual lived before leaving Japan to impose personal income tax on the individual even if the shares or other financial assets are sold after the individual moved to Japan. Therefore, when implementing this scheme, careful prior research on local laws would be essential.

          <h3 class="h3-title left">At the end</h3>
          <p class="p-text left">This article discussed cases in which the use of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur may be effective.
            In particular, the author strongly hopes that investors living abroad will also pay attention to the special tax exemption for entrepreneur. Here, I would like to mention the reasons for this.<br>
            In Japan, the effective tax rate for high-income individuals is unusually high (the highest rate is 55.945%, including local taxes). Furthermore, sole proprietors who work as freelancers are subject to a personal business tax, except for certain types of businesses. As a result, the author has witnessed many cases of talented people shunning Japan's high taxation and deciding to move overseas. It is of course important for Japan's international competitiveness that talented entrepreneurs from abroad return to Japan in order to stem this trend. The key to this is, of course, Japan's tax system.<br>
            That is why I would like to make those living abroad who have successfully established businesses overseas aware of the appeal of this tax-saving scheme using Japan's special tax exception for entrepreneur, and would like these talented businessmen to revitalize Japanese economy.<br>
            For your information, the corporate tax system in Japan after starting a business is not so strict compared to that of other developed countries in the world. Above all, beautiful nature and scenery, well-preserved security, rich food culture, and hospitality await you here in Japan.</p>
