    <p class="p-title center p-top-title02">~Let‘s get a basic knowledge of special tax exemption for entrepreneur~</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">What is this "new form of tax reduction by selling shares to form a company? </h3>
    <p class="p-text left">This is the so-called " special tax exemption for entrepreneur" a tax exemption program established in April 2023 as an addition to the existing angel tax program. In this article, we will provide an overview of the " special tax exemption for entrepreneur " reading into its default meaning.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">What’s the special tax exemption for entrepreneur？</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">The "special tax exemption for entrepreneurs" is a program that allows an individual who establishes a company as a promoter and acquires shares of stock by way of cash contribution to deduct the amount of paid-in capital of one's own company from the capital gain on the sale of the shares. In other words, if you start a business using funds from the sale of your stock holdings, you will be exempt from tax on capital gains on the sale of your own stock, if certain conditions are fulfilled. The tax-exempt gains on sales are not limited to stocks, but also include investment trusts, bonds, and other financial assets. Apparently, this program is intended to stimulate the Japanese economy by supporting entrepreneurs who use their financial assets to launch new ventures. Since this is a very interesting program, let us review the details below.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">How to reduce tax liability by using the special tax exemption for entrepreneur</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">Let me illustrate again how this special tax exemption for entrepreneur works to save him (or her) tax liability. Normally, when an individual investor earns income on the sales of stocks, etc., capital gains tax rate of 20.315% (including 5% inhabitant tax) shall be applied.<br>
      However, if the investor establishes his or her own company as a promoter under certain conditions, the income caused by the sales of stock etc. can be exempt from personal income tax by the amount equivalent to the investment in the company at the time of its establishment. To avoid misunderstanding, this system shall be applied only to national tax and shall not be applied to local tax (i.e., inhabitant tax). Even so, the exemption from income tax (currently 15.315%), which is applied to capital gains tax on financial assets, must be attractive for the entrepreneur.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="p-text left">This special tax exemption for entrepreneur allows up to JPY2 billion to be exempted from taxes. It must be a groundbreaking program that encourages entrepreneurs who wish to launch a large-scale venture business. Although the illustration assumes that the entrepreneur starts a business after the sale of stock, it is also applicable to entrepreneurs who start a company as a promoter at first and then sell their stocks during the same calendar year, recognizing income on the sales of their stocks.</p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="h3-title left">Requirement for application of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur</h3>
    <p class="p-text left">The requirements for application of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur seems to be divided into two main categories: "individual requirements" and "corporate requirements.<br>
      With regard to individual requirements, there are 3 points.<br>
      The first is that the person who recognized capital gain on the sales of stocks etc. should be the promoter of the company. Second, the investment in the new established company must be executed by way of cash, and then the incorporated company must be a Kabushiki Kaisha, meaning that an equity company such as Godo Kaisha cannot be approved. Investments in a stock company may be made in the form of class shares as long as the payment is made in cash.<br>
      It should be noted that the definition of "in money" means investments in kind cannot be approved for application of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur.<br><br>
      The third requirement may be a bit confusing. It states that “the applicant must not be an individual or a relative of the individual who has transferred his/her businesses to the newly established company”, which means that even if a person transfers his or her own business as a sole proprietor to a new company and conducts a similar business, he or she cannot be considered to have created a new business, therefore, such kind of business transfer cannot be in accordance with the purpose of this tax program, Same is true even if a business is started by taking over the business of a relative or other family member.</p>
      <div class="top-image">
        <img src="./images/top/article-en-04.png" alt="Personal Requirements">
      </div>
      <p class="p-text02 left">Next, let's look at the "company requirements.<br>
        For a better understanding, please refer to the requirements for "Company I【企業Ⅰ】" through "Company VII【企業Ⅶ】" on the METI special website below.<br>
        <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/policy/newbusiness/angeltax/startup.html" target="_blank">Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry【Outline of special tax exemption for entrepreneur】</a><br>
        The first requirement is that the company must be "a small or medium-sized enterprise that has been in business for less than one year.<br>
        In this context, Small and medium-sized enterprises are defined in Article 2, Items 1 through 5 of the "Law for Strengthening Management of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, etc.".<br>
        Each industry has its own limits on the amount of capital and the number of full-time employees.<br>
        This definition of Small and medium-sized enterprises varies by industry, and each industry has its own criteria for the amount of capital and the number of full-time employees.</p>
        <p class="p-center center">【Definition of SMEs under the Law for Strengthening Management of Small and Medium Enterprises, etc.】</p>
        <div class="top-image article05">
          <img src="./images/top/article-en-05.png" alt="Personal Requirements">
        </div>
        <p class="p-text02 left">Either one of the two requirements, the Amount of capital or Number of regular employees, needs to be satisfied. For example, in the case of a software business, even if the amount of capital exceeds JPY300 million, as long as the number of regular employees is 300 persons or less, the business is treated as a small or medium-sized enterprise. I explain that the special tax exemption for entrepreneur is a tax-exempt system with a maximum of JPY2 billion, this means that even a high investment exceeding the capital requirement stipulated in the Law for Strengthening Management of Small and Medium Enterprises, etc., is allowed up to JPY2 billion if the number of regular employee requirement under the Law is met.<br><br>
          The "less than one year" requirement is also explained here.<br>
          This requirement is based on the status of the company as of December 31 in the year of incorporation. Therefore, in most cases, the company will be established and apply for a special tax exemption for entrepreneur as a newly established company before the first fiscal year ends as of December 31, but there may be cases where a company is established, and the fiscal year ends in the middle of that year, and the company starts its second fiscal year before December 31st. In order to allow such a case to be treated as a substantial newly established corporation and to apply this program, the definition of "small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their first fiscal year" is not used to define the target companies, but this program dare to define "companies that have been in business for less than one year" as the target companies.<br>
          Relatedly, the corporate requirements classify companies that have been in existence for less than one year as "company that have not met the first fiscal year end as of December 31 of the year of incorporation" and "company that have already met the first fiscal year end as of December31 if the year of incorporation, and then the requirements for full-time researchers, etc. and selling and administrative expenses are defined for each case.</p>
          <h3 class="h3-title left">The special tax exemption for entrepreneur requires business novelty</h3>
          <p class="p-text left">This corporate requirement also requires that the new established company should be an unregistered or unlisted corporation that is not owned by a large corporation, and the newly established corporation is required not to be engaged in a business transferred from another business as its principal business. In addition, the newly established company is also required to prepare at least two full-time researchers or other engaged persons who can work for the new business, except in certain cases.<br>
            This suggests METI's intention to support venture business start-ups that take on the challenge of developing new products and providing new services not found in existing businesses, in an environment not dominated by large corporations. Therefore, METI will not readily approve an application for a special tax exemption for entrepreneur simply because the applicant has set up a company as a promoter and invested funds in the company by himself/herself. As with the previous angel taxation system, it should be interpreted that a certain degree of novelty is required with respect to the nature of the business.<br>
            Moreover, this tax exemption program also requires that the company need to accept at least 1% investment from outside parties (other than a specific group of shareholders) as of December 31 of the year of incorporation. That is to say, it is also important to note that so-called one shareholder company cannot apply for the program.</p>
          <h3 class="h3-title left">Application for confirmation to the prefectural government and a tax return are required.</h3>
          <p class="p-text left">Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the practice of the special tax exemption for entrepreneurs. Since this special tax exemption exempts income from the transfer of stocks and other securities from personal income taxation, it is not difficult to imagine that a tax return is required. Before the promotor proceeds with his or her tax filing, the said promoter must file an application for confirmation with the prefectural government that has jurisdiction over the location of the incorporated company, and must receive a written confirmation so that he or she can attach it to the personal tax filing form.<br>
            Since the fulfillment of the corporate requirements is judged dated on December 31, it is not possible to receive this confirmation during the year the company is established, and a request for confirmation cannot be made to the prefectural government until the following year.<br>
            Therefore, since there is not enough time to prepare before March 15of the following year, the deadline for personal income tax filing, preparations for applying for confirmation with the prefectural government should be made as soon as possible.</p>

          <h3 class="h3-title left">At the end</h3>
          <p class="p-text left">This article outlines a new type of tax-saving measure so called the " Special tax exemption for entrepreneur" a new type of tax-saving measure that does not exist in Conventional Angel Taxation (Incentive A, Incentive B). Under the conventional Angel Taxation program, investors could receive preferential tax treatment by investing in external venture companies that met the eligibility requirements for preferential tax treatment A or B, while the special tax exemption for entrepreneurs is that promotor can create their own venture business and receive preferential tax treatment by investing in their own company. Isn't this a very innovative program?<br>
            In addition, the tax exemption of up to JPY2 billion is also attractive.<br>
            I am a certified tax accountant in Japan. In my next post, therefore, I would like to consider specifically under what circumstances an investor can effectively save taxes by taking advantage of the special tax exemption for entrepreneur, and then would like to introduce some tax-saving schemes.</p>
